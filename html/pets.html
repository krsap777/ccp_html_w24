            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <img src="images/turtleinacast.jpeg" width = "400" alt="turtleinacast">

            <p>my pet turtle has a broken leg. I took him to uhs but they just gave him tylonal. Now he won't stop talking about how much he wants a panchuros burrito. Thinking of signing him up for weight watchers, but I dont want to hurt his feelings. Last time I pointed out the pimple on his 5 head he wouldn't speak to me for four days.</p>
